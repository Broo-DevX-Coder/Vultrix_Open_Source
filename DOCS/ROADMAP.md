## ✅ Current Stage (Q3 2025)
- [x] Project initialization  
- [x] Core structure (`Program/`, `Data/`, `trading_charts/`, …)  
- [x] Binance API integration (REST + WebSocket)  
- [x] Basic chart rendering with Matplotlib  
- [x] User authentication (local storage + encryption)  
- [x] Documentation setup (`README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE_ISLAMIC.md`, etc.)  

---

## 🚀 Short-Term Goals (Next 3–6 months)
- [ ] Implement **payment & verification system**  
- [ ] Add new **paid plugins** for indicators (Volume Heatmap, CVD, Footprint, etc.) → these remain **closed-source**  
- [ ] Add new **GUI windows** (e.g., `Trades`, `Plugins Marketplace`, etc.)  
- [ ] Implement **plugin loader** (currently closed-source)  
- [ ] Release an **initial set of official plugins**  
- [ ] Provide an **internal API** in the application for:  
  - Listing installed plugins  
  - Verifying plugin licenses (paid plugins)  
  - Downloading/adding user-plugins from `~/.vultrix/Plugins`

## 📌 Notes
- This roadmap is **not strict**; priorities may shift.  
- Feedback and community contributions are welcome.
